# beanstalkd-console cookbook

Chef cookbook that installs beanstalkd-console and installs a service to run it on startup

# Requirements

 - **My version** of the PHP cookbook: do this in Cheffile

        cookbook "php", { :github => "kohenkatz/my-chef-php" }

 - Currently only tested on Ubuntu 14.04
 - Beanstalkd - Actually, I don't think it actually depends on this. But what's the point of installing this cookbook without Beanstalkd?
